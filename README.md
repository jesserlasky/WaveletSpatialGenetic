## Genome-wide wavelet dissimilarity
This file contains a script with example SNP and geographic coordinate datasets (included here): ExampleGenomicWavDissim2.R
This shows how to use my code to calculate genome-wide wavelet dissimilarity, using the SNP matrix and the coordinates of samples. It also shows how to plot the mean dissimilarity among sites compared to a null, as well as a the local dissimilarity at each sampled site compared to a null, across a range of spatial scales.
