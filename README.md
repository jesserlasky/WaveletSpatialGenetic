## Genome-wide wavelet dissimilarity
[This file](https://github.com/jesserlasky/WaveletSpatialGenetic/blob/main/ExampleGenomicWavDissim2.R), "ExampleGenomicWavDissim2.R", contains a script with example SNP and geographic coordinate datasets (included in this repository).
This shows how to use my code to calculate genome-wide wavelet dissimilarity, using the SNP matrix and the coordinates of samples. It also shows how to plot the mean dissimilarity among sites compared to a null, as well as a the local dissimilarity at each sampled site compared to a null, across a range of spatial scales.
